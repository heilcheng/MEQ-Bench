# MEQ-Bench: A Resource-Efficient Benchmark for Evaluating Audience-Adaptive Explanation Quality in Medical Large Language Models

## Abstract

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare requires not only medical accuracy but also the ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences. Current benchmarks, which often focus on multiple-choice questions, fail to evaluate this critical capability and are becoming saturated. We present MEQ-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess an LLM's ability to generate audience-adaptive medical explanations for four key stakeholders: physicians, nurses, patients, and caregivers. This multi-audience framework addresses a significant gap in medical AI evaluation. Unlike traditional approaches requiring extensive human annotation, MEQ-Bench employs a resource-efficient methodology leveraging existing, high-quality medical datasets, a multi-dimensional automated evaluation framework, and a validated LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework is optimized for open-weight models that can run on consumer hardware, making rigorous medical AI evaluation more accessible to independent researchers.

## Key Features

- **Novel Evaluation Framework**: First benchmark to systematically evaluate audience-adaptive medical explanations
- **Resource-Efficient Methodology**: Uses existing validated medical datasets, eliminating costly de novo content creation
- **Validated Automated Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional scoring with LLM-as-a-judge paradigm
- **Democratized Access**: Optimized for open-weight models on consumer hardware (e.g., Apple Silicon)

## Target Audiences

MEQ-Bench evaluates explanations tailored for four key healthcare stakeholders:

1. **Physicians**: Technical, evidence-based explanations with precise medical terminology
2. **Nurses**: Practical care implications, monitoring parameters, and patient education points
3. **Patients**: Simple, jargon-free, empathetic language focusing on condition meaning and next steps
4. **Caregivers**: Concrete tasks, symptoms to watch for, and when to seek help

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heilcheng/MEQ-Bench.git
cd MEQ-Bench
pip install .
```

For development with additional tools:
```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

For full installation with all optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install .[full]
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a complete example demonstrating how to use MEQ-Bench to evaluate a model's ability to generate audience-adaptive medical explanations:

```python
from src.benchmark import MEQBench
from src.evaluator import MEQBenchEvaluator

# Step 1: Import the necessary classes
print("Setting up MEQ-Bench evaluation...")

# Step 2: Initialize MEQBench
bench = MEQBench()
print(f"Initialized MEQ-Bench with {len(bench.benchmark_items)} items")

# Step 3: Define a dummy model function for demonstration
def dummy_model_function(prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Example model function that returns audience-adaptive explanations.
    In practice, replace this with your actual model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
    """
    return """For a Physician: Hypertension (HTN) is a chronic medical condition characterized by persistently elevated arterial blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg. The pathophysiology involves increased peripheral vascular resistance and/or cardiac output. Consider ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy per JNC guidelines.

For a Nurse: Monitor patient's blood pressure regularly and watch for signs of hypertensive crisis. Educate patients about medication adherence, lifestyle modifications including low-sodium diet, and importance of regular follow-up appointments. Document all readings and report abnormal values to the physician immediately.

For a Patient: High blood pressure means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood. This can damage your heart and blood vessels over time. Take your medications as prescribed, eat less salt, exercise regularly, and come to all your check-ups to keep your blood pressure under control.

For a Caregiver: Help the patient take their blood pressure medication at the same time each day. Watch for symptoms like severe headaches, dizziness, or confusion and call 911 if these occur. Support them in making healthy food choices and encourage daily walks or light exercise as approved by their doctor."""

# Step 4: Define sample medical content to evaluate
sample_medical_content = """
Hypertension is a common cardiovascular condition where blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. 
It affects approximately 45% of adults and is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. 
Management typically involves lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications.
"""

print("\nGenerating audience-adaptive explanations...")

# Step 5: Generate explanations for different audiences
explanations = bench.generate_explanations(
    medical_content=sample_medical_content,
    model_func=dummy_model_function
)

print(f"Generated explanations for {len(explanations)} audiences:")
for audience in explanations:
    print(f"  - {audience}: {len(explanations[audience])} characters")

# Step 6: Initialize MEQBenchEvaluator
print("\nInitializing evaluator...")
evaluator = MEQBenchEvaluator()

# Step 7: Evaluate explanations for all audiences
print("Evaluating explanations...")
evaluation_results = evaluator.evaluate_all_audiences(
    original=sample_medical_content,
    explanations=explanations
)

# Step 8: Print overall scores for each audience
print("\n" + "="*60)
print("EVALUATION RESULTS")
print("="*60)

for audience, scores in evaluation_results.items():
    print(f"\n{audience.upper()} AUDIENCE:")
    print(f"  Overall Score: {scores.overall:.3f}")
    print(f"  Readability:   {scores.readability:.3f}")
    print(f"  Terminology:   {scores.terminology:.3f}")
    print(f"  Safety:        {scores.safety:.3f}")
    print(f"  Coverage:      {scores.coverage:.3f}")
    print(f"  Quality:       {scores.quality:.3f}")

# Calculate and display average performance
all_scores = [scores.overall for scores in evaluation_results.values()]
average_score = sum(all_scores) / len(all_scores)
print(f"\nAVERAGE PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL AUDIENCES: {average_score:.3f}")

print("\n" + "="*60)
print("Evaluation completed successfully!")
```
