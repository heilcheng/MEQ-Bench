"""Strategy pattern implementation for audience-specific scoring.

This module implements the Strategy pattern to handle audience-specific scoring
logic for medical explanation evaluation. Each audience (physician, nurse, patient,
caregiver) has different expectations for readability, terminology, and explanation
length, which are encapsulated in separate strategy classes.

The module provides:
    - Abstract base class for audience strategies
    - Concrete strategy implementations for each audience type
    - Factory pattern for creating appropriate strategies
    - Audience-specific scoring algorithms for readability and terminology

Example:
    ```python
    from strategies import StrategyFactory
    
    # Create strategy for specific audience
    strategy = StrategyFactory.create_strategy('patient')
    
    # Calculate audience-specific scores
    readability_score = strategy.calculate_readability_score(text, grade_level)
    terminology_score = strategy.calculate_terminology_score(text, term_density)
    ```
